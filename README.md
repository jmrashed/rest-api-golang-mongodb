# RESTful API with Go and MongoDB

This repository contains a sample implementation of a RESTful API using the Go programming language and MongoDB as the database. It demonstrates the basic structure and components of a typical Go-based API project.

## Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized directory structure to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. Here's an overview of the main directories:

- **cmd**: Contains the entry point of the application (`main.go`).
- **internal**: Contains the internal components of the application that are not meant to be imported externally.
  - **config**: Handles configuration setup and management.
  - **handler**: Implements the request handling logic.
  - **middleware**: Defines middleware components for the request-response cycle.
  - **model**: Defines data models and structures.
  - **repository**: Implements database operations and data access logic.
  - **router**: Sets up the router and handles route mapping.
  - **service**: Implements the business logic layer.
  - **util**: Contains utility functions shared across components.
- **migrations**: Stores database migration scripts.
- **scripts**: Contains helper and automation scripts.
